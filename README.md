# GenMtx

# Matrix generator in Python 3

This code consists of matrix generators for PowerMEIS code.
The user can specify several NanoParticle (NP) shapes and piling structures.

# Installation

$ git clone

# Documentation

The goal of the present .py file is to share a robust, parallelized code to generate matrices (.mtx) to run in the PowerMEIS code (PowerMEIS link)[tars.if.ufrgs.br].

## Shapes of the NPs

Three NP shapes can be chosen:

1. Core-shell Structures (one element in the core and another in the shell);
2. Interpenetrated Spheres;
3. Separated Spheres.

## Piling Structure of the NPs:

Considering that the NPs are spread over a substrate, the following agglomeration structures can be chosen:

1. Pyramids with hexagonal (several variations can be chosen) or square bases constituted by NPs;
2. Piling structure forming a cubic or rectangular structure;
3. Column-like piling of NPs;
4. Fcc piling of NPs.

# Suported Python Versions

The code can be run with Python 3.0 or above.
